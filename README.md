Open-Access Qbank Software Catered to Question Writers

## The Goal
Hi! Thanks for checking out my repository. I'm a medical student with 0 coding experience trying to muddle my way through an idea. The simple concept is to create a question bank where students write questions, receive binary feedback with optional comments from their classmates, and can create quizzes for themselves from the bank of questions. Appropriate filters will be needed such as sorting by course, exam, lecture, etc. 

I will post a schematic of my idea here soon.

## So What?
Keep an eye on this page if you are interested. If you have any ideas on how to make this happen, please reach out! My goal is to assemble this over the next 2 years (until March 2023).
